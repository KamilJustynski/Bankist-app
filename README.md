# Bankist APP

## Banking application project :) 

### The first step is to log in to the application, we have two accounts to choose from

login: kj pin: 1111
login: jd pin: 2222

### After logging in, we go to the banking window where we see

Deposits,
payouts,
account balance,
interest yield, which is calculated differently for each account
sum of payments,
sum of withdrawals

### In the bank account window we can perform the following operations

Transfer from the account where we are logged in to one of the 2 accounts mentioned above
take out a loan that does not exceed more than 10% of the largest amount deposited into the account
delete the account, after trying to log in again - the account does not exist
sorting transfers, from smallest to largest (bottom to top)
